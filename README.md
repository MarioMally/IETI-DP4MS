# IETI-DP4MS
This repository contains the code to generate the numerical data employed in the paper "Tree-cotree-based tearing and interconnecting for 3D magnetostatics: A dual-primal approach" https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2025.117737.

Our implementations are based on
  - NURBS-Package (version 1.4.3) M. Spink, D. Claxton, C. de Falco, R. Vazquez, The NURBS toolbox, http://octave.sourceforge.net/nurbs/index.html.
  - GeoPDEs (latest version included as submodule) R. Vazquez, A new design for the implementation of isogeometric analysis in Octave and Matlab: GeoPDEs 3.0, Computers and Mathematics with Applications, 72(3):523-554, 2016.

### Instructions
Run the scripts in Folder "ieti-dp4ms/code/scripts" to generate numerical data and compare them to the reference data of the paper.
